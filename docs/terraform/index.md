## What is Terraform & IaC?

### What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (servers, networks, databases, firewalls) through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

### What is Terraform?
**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code tool created by **HashiCorp**. It allows developers and DevOps engineers to define both cloud and on-premises resources in human-readable configuration files using **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**.

> **Key Definition**: Terraform provides a unified workflow to provision, change, and version-control infrastructure safely and efficiently across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes) simultaneously.

## Imperative vs. Declarative IaC

| Feature | Imperative IaC (e.g., Bash, AWS CLI) | Declarative IaC (Terraform) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approach** | You define **how** to achieve the state (step-by-step scripts). | You define **what** the final state should look like. |
| **State Tracking** | No built-in state awareness; risk of duplicate provisioning. | Maintains a `.tfstate` file to track real-world resources. |
| **Idempotency** | Difficult to guarantee without extra logic. | Built-in idempotency (re-applying produces exact target state). |

## Key Benefits of Terraform

- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Single workflow to manage multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack).
- **State Management**: Tracks real-world resource state and maps configurations to deployed infrastructure.
- **Dependency Graph**: Automatically determines resource dependencies and parallelizes provisioning.
- **Drift Detection**: Detects manual changes made outside of Terraform and restores desired state.

---

## Core Concepts & Terminology

- **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**: The declarative configuration language used by Terraform.
- **Provider**: A plugin that translates HCL definitions into API calls for specific platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Resource**: An infrastructure object (VM, VPC, S3 bucket, Security Group) defined in code.
- **State File (`.tfstate`)**: A JSON file mapping configuration resources to real-world cloud IDs.
- **Module**: A container for multiple resources configured together to encourage reusability.

---

## The Standard Terraform Workflow

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure resources in `.tf` files using HCL.
2. **Init**: Run `terraform init` to download required provider plugins and modules.
3. **Plan**: Run `terraform plan` to preview execution plan and changes before applying.
4. **Apply**: Run `terraform apply` to provision or modify infrastructure to match target configuration.
5. **Destroy**: Run `terraform destroy` to tear down managed infrastructure safely.
