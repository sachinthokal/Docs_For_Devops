## What is GitHub?

### Definition
**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service and platform built around the Git version control system. It provides a graphical web interface, access control, social networking features, issue tracking, software planning tools, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

> **Key Definition**: If **Git** is the engine that tracks code revisions on your computer, **GitHub** is the cloud hub that lets developers share, review, test, and collaborate on code globally.

## The Standard GitHub Workflow

1. **Fork/Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. **Create a Feature Branch** to work on a specific task (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. **Commit & Push** your changes to your remote GitHub branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub to propose merging into the target branch.
5. **Code Review & CI/CD Checks**: Teammates review code; automated tests run via GitHub Actions.
6. **Merge**: Once approved and tests pass, merge the PR into the main branch.
