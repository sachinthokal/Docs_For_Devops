## What is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps** (Development, Security, and Operations) is the practice of integrating security testing and compliance checks seamlessly into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), rather than treating security as an isolated, final audit step.

> **Key Definition**: DevSecOps automates security controls within the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that code, third-party dependencies, container images, and cloud infrastructure are scanned for vulnerabilities before reaching production.

## Shift Left Security Principle

```
TRADITIONAL DEVOPS (Security as a bottleneck at the end)
[ Plan ] -> [ Code ] -> [ Build ] -> [ Test ] -> [ Deploy ] -> | SECURITY AUDIT | -> Outage/Fixes

DEVSECOPS (Shift-Left Security embedded continuously)
[ Plan ]  ->  [ Code ]  ->  [ Build ]  ->  [ Test ]  ->  [ Deploy ]
  (Threat       (SAST &       (SCA &        (DAST &       (Runtime &
  Modeling)    Linting)      Container)    PenTest)       Guardrails)
```

## Key Security Testing Methodologies

| Security Type | Full Name | Focus Area | Example Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SAST** | Static Application Security Testing | Source code static analysis for code flaws. | SonarQube, Semgrep, Checkmarx |
| **SCA** | Software Composition Analysis | Open-source dependencies & CVE scanning. | Trivy, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check |
| **Secret Scanning** | Hardcoded Credentials Detection | Scans git commit history for keys/passwords. | Trufflehog, Gitleaks |
| **Container Sec** | Container Image Vulnerability Scanning| Scans OS packages inside Docker images. | Trivy, Grype, Clair |
| **DAST** | Dynamic Application Security Testing | Web vulnerability scanning against running apps.| OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite |
