## What is Azure DevOps?

**Azure DevOps** is an enterprise-grade SaaS and on-premises suite provided by Microsoft that provides end-to-end DevOps toolchains for developing, testing, building, and deploying applications.

> **Key Definition**: Azure DevOps combines Agile planning tools (Boards), code hosting (Repos), enterprise CI/CD pipelines (Pipelines), package hosting (Artifacts), and automated testing (Test Plans).

- **Pipeline**: The workflow configuration that defines how code is built, tested, and deployed.
- **Stage**: A logical collection of related jobs (e.g., `Build`, `Test`, `Deploy_Staging`, `Deploy_Prod`).
- **Job**: A series of steps run by an agent node.
- **Agent Pool**: A cluster of build/deployment agents (Microsoft-hosted or Self-hosted).
- **Service Connection**: Secure credential configuration enabling Pipelines to connect to external clouds (Azure, AWS, Kubernetes).
