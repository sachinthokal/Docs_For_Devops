## What is Ansible?

**Ansible** is an open-source IT automation engine created by **Michael DeHaan** (acquired by Red Hat). It automates configuration management, task execution, application deployment, cloud provisioning, and intra-service orchestration.

> **Key Definition**: Ansible is an **agentless, declarative automation platform** that configures remote infrastructure over standard SSH or WinRM connections using simple, human-readable **YAML Playbooks**.

---

## Key Advantages of Ansible

- **Agentless**: No software or daemon needs to be installed on target nodes; operates over SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows).
- **Human-Readable (YAML)**: Automation routines are written in plain YAML syntax (Playbooks).
- **Idempotent**: Execution checks current node state; tasks execute only if changes are required to reach desired state.
- **Extensible**: Powered by thousands of built-in and community modules (Ansible Galaxy).

## Agentless vs. Agent-Based Architecture

```
Agent-Based Architecture (e.g., Puppet, Chef)
[ Control Server ] ---> Network ---> [ Target Node + Agent Daemon running ]

Agentless Architecture (Ansible)
[ Ansible Control Node ] ---> OpenSSH / WinRM ---> [ Target Node (Native OS) ]
```

---

## Core Concepts & Terminology

- **Control Node**: Any machine running Linux/Unix with Ansible installed, used to execute automation commands.
- **Managed Nodes**: The target servers, network devices, or VMs managed by the Control Node.
- **Inventory**: A file (INI or YAML) containing hostnames, IP addresses, and group definitions for target managed nodes.
- **Module**: A discrete unit of code (Python/PowerShell) executed on target nodes (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, `service`).
- **Task**: An action statement calling a single Ansible module with specific parameters.
- **Playbook**: A YAML file containing one or more plays that map tasks to specific inventory host groups.
- **Role**: A structured directory layout containing tasks, handlers, variables, and templates for reusable automation.
