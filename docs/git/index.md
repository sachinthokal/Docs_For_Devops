## What is Git & Version Control?

### What is Version Control System (VCS)?
A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a software tool that tracks and manages changes to code, files, and documents over time. It allows developers to:
- Keep a complete revision history of a project.
- Revert files or the entire project back to a previous state.
- Compare changes over time.
- Collaborate with other developers without overwriting each other's work.

### What is Git?
**Git** is a **free, open-source, distributed version control system (DVCS)** created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 (the creator of Linux) to manage the Linux kernel development.

> **Key Definition**: Git records snapshots of your file system over time. Unlike older systems that store file-by-file differences (diffs), Git thinks of its data more like a series of **miniature snapshots** of the entire repository.

## Why Git? Key Benefits

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Speed & Performance** | Almost all operations occur locally on your machine, making them blistering fast. |
| **Distributed Architecture** | Every developer has a full copy of the project history on their local machine. |
| **Data Integrity** | Everything in Git is check-summed using cryptographic SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes before it is stored. |
| **Non-Linear Development** | Frictionless branching and merging allow thousands of parallel feature branches. |
| **Offline Work** | You can commit, branch, view logs, and diff code without an internet connection. |

## Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control

```
Centralized VCS (e.g., SVN, CVS)          Distributed VCS (e.g., Git, Mercurial)

    +-------------------+                       +-------------------+
    | Central Server    |                       | Remote Repository |
    | (Repository)      |                       | (GitHub/GitLab)   |
    +---------+---------+                       +---------+---------+
              |                                           |
      +-------+-------+                           +-------+-------+
      |               |                           |               |
+-----v-----+   +-----v-----+               +-----v-----+   +-----v-----+
| Client 1  |   | Client 2  |               | Local Repo|   | Local Repo|
| (Working) |   | (Working) |               | (Client 1)|   | (Client 2)|
+-----------+   +-----------+               +-----------+   +-----------+
```

* **Centralized VCS**: Single central server holds the entire project history. If the server goes down, no one can commit or view history.
* **Distributed VCS (Git)**: Every client clones the *entire repository*, including the full project history. The server is just another node in the network.

## Core Concepts & Terminology

- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory containing your project files and the hidden `.git` folder that tracks all historical changes.
- **Commit**: An immutable snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, identified by a unique 40-character SHA-1 hash.
- **Working Directory**: The local folder on your computer where you edit files.
- **Staging Area (Index)**: A draft area where you stage changes before saving them into a commit.
- **Branch**: A lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit.
- **HEAD**: A reference pointer pointing to the current active branch or commit.
- **Remote**: A common repository hosted on the internet or a network (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

---

## The Basic Git Workflow

1. **Modify** files in your **Working Directory**.
2. **Stage** the modified files using `git add` to place them into the **Staging Area**.
3. **Commit** the staged files using `git commit` to permanently record the snapshot in your **Local Repository**.
4. **Push** local commits using `git push` to synchronize with a **Remote Repository**.
