## What is Docker & Containerization?

### What is Containerization?
Containerization is an OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run applications without launching an entire virtual machine (VM). Containers bundle an application's code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings into a single isolated package.

### What is Docker?
**Docker** is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight containers.

> **Key Definition**: Docker ensures that an application works consistently across any environment—whether on a developer's laptop, testing server, or cloud infrastructure ("Works on my machine" problem solved).

## Virtual Machines vs. Containers

| Feature | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Docker Containers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virtualization Level** | Hardware-level (Hypervisor) | OS-level (Shared Host Kernel) |
| **Startup Time** | Minutes | Milliseconds to Seconds |
| **Size / Footprint** | Gigabytes (includes full OS) | Megabytes (lightweight) |
| **Performance** | Higher overhead | Near-native speed |
| **Isolation** | Strong hardware-level isolation | Process-level isolation |

## Key Benefits of Docker

- **Consistency**: Guarantees identical execution environments across dev, staging, and production.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shares host kernel resources, allowing dozens of containers on a single host.
- **Portability**: Run containers anywhere Docker is supported (AWS, Azure, GCP, On-Premises).
- **Fast Deployment**: Spin up application instances instantly.

---

## Core Terminology

- **Docker Image**: A read-only blueprint containing application code, dependencies, and execution instructions.
- **Docker Container**: A runnable, isolated instance created from a Docker Image.
- **Dockerfile**: A plain text configuration file containing step-by-step commands to build a Docker Image.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry for sharing and downloading container images.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a single YAML file.
